# 🌌 Space Debris Harvester‑Refinery Simulator
A fully interactive, browser‑based simulation demonstrating how **orbital debris can be collected, processed, and reused** to support a sustainable circular space economy.

🔗 **Live Simulation:** https://orbit-resource-relay.lovable.app/

---

## 🚀 Overview
The **Space Debris Harvester‑Refinery Simulator** models a futuristic approach to orbital sustainability. Instead of treating debris as waste, it demonstrates how debris can be **harvested as a resource**, refined into valuable materials, and used to offset mission costs.

This simulator visualizes **collection missions**, **economic outcomes**, and **material recovery** in real‑time.

---

## 🎯 Key Features
- **Smart Prioritization Algorithm**
  - Ranks debris based on threat, value, and accessibility.
- **Real‑Time or Accelerated Simulation**
  - Watch missions unfold day‑by‑day, month‑by‑month, or year‑by‑year.
- **Economic Modeling**
  - Tracks costs, recovered material value, and profit/loss.
- **Mission Flexibility**
  - User‑adjustable mission duration, targets, and recovery efficiency.
- **Comprehensive Visualization Dashboard**
  - 6+ charts showing orbit distribution, material breakdown, and mission progress.
